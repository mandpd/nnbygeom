# Overview

This project is an exploration of how neural networks work by examining their effect on the feature space of the data they are intended to learn from.

I'm writing it to discover more about the [convnetjs](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) package which provides a neural net implementation in javascript and the graphics package D3.

I believe that visualizing how neural nets and their descendents CNNs and RNNs are doing what they do is vital to optimizing the parameters that optimize them.
