# Geometry

There is a heirarchy of planar transformations that we may need to apply to the feature space. They are

**Projective** - a square can be transformed into any more general quadrilateral where no 3 points are collinear

**Affine** - equivalent to the composed effects of translation, rotation, isotropic scaling and shear.

**Similarity**

**Euclidean** - only rotations and translations are allowed
